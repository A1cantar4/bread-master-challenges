# 🧙‍♂️ CHALLENGE 01 — The Initial Counter

## 🎯 Description:
You are the new attendant at the Master of Bread Bakery.

Your first challenge is simple: serve a customer and record their order. The system must ask for the customer's name and the type of bread they want, then display a message confirming the order.

## 📌 Rules:
1. The name and type of bread must be entered by the user.
2. The final message must include both pieces of information.
3. Use `input()` and `print().`
4. Make the message nice and welcoming — this is a traditional bakery!

## 💡 Example:
> What is your name? João
> What bread would you like today? French
> Order registered: João ordered a French bread. Thank you for your preference!

## 🧪 Tests:
- Try with different names and breads (whole wheat, French, sweet, etc.)
